# Robots-The-Game
Similar to gnome-robots game on Linux, coded in Java.
In this game, the player's character is placed on a grid with some number of robots. Each turn the player can do one of the following: stay put, move to one of the eight adjacent spaces, or teleport to a random spot on the board.

After the player moves, each robot takes a turn moving one space closer to the player. If the robot hits the player (or the player hits a robot), the game is over. If a robot hits another robot, both are destroyed and replaced with a pile of rubble. If a robot hits a pile of rubble, the robot is destroyed and the rubble remains.
